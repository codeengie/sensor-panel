# Sensor Panel

**A set of sensor panel skins for Rainmeter and AIDA64.**

## Description
Sensor panel skins for Rainmeter and AIDA64 provide PC enthusiasts with a powerful and customizable way to monitor their system's vitals statistics in real-time. These skins transform raw data into visually appealing displays, allowing users to track CPU usage, temperatures, fan speeds, GPU performance, RAM utilization and more. By leveraging the extensive sensor data provided by AIDA64 and the flexibility of Rainmeter's skinning system I was able to create a skin tailored to water cooled system.
